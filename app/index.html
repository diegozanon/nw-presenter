## What is NW Presenter?

- A desktop app that presents slideshows
- Its multi-platform because NW.js is used
- Interface is a HTML5 slideshow
- Mardown formatting to create each slide
- Syntax highlighting for code
---
## Why use it?

- If you want to convince others of how powerful NW.js is to create desktop apps, presenting its advantages using its own technology is a good start.
---
## Why use it?

- Embed any fancy HTML5 code inside your presentation and it will execute as it would in any browser. That's great to teach how to use Angular, React, Ember, etc.
- It can be used for any kind of presentation. If you are interested only in the HTML5 slideshow, try https://github.com/gnab/remark
---
## How to execute it?

- Download instructions

---
## How to create an slideshow?

- Slideshows are created using Markdown formatting
- Markdown is compiled using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)
- For a remark tutorial, follow this: http://gnab.github.io/remark/#1
---
## Demo

- As a demo app, the following slides were created to present what NW.js is
---
## NW.js 

- NW.js (formerly knows as Node-Webkit) is an app runtime based on Chromium and Node.js
- NW.js is used to create multi-platform desktop apps
- Chromium is used to render the interface that is created using HTML/CSS/JS
- All Node.js modules can be used directly from the DOM
---
## Features

- Interface is written using HTML/CSS/JS
- Complete support for Node.js
- Available on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
- Easy to package and distribute
---
## Design

- As a web-desktop app, you can use any web component

---
## Quick Start

- Download: visite the [official repo](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/#downloads) for an updated version
---
## Quick Start

- Create a file named as **package.json**

```javascript
{
  "name": "nw-hello-world",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.html",
  "window": {
    "toolbar": false,
    "icon": "my-app-icon.png",
    "fullscreen": false,
    "resizable" : true,
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600,
    "min_width": 400,
    "min_height": 300
  }
}
```
---
## Quick Start

- Create a file named as **index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <div id="my-img"></div>  
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
---
## Quick Start

- As you see, this HTML have:
  - An empty div tag with **id="my-img"**
  - Reference to a minified version of jQuery
  - Reference to an **app.js** file where we'll add our Node.js code
---
## Quick Start

- Create a file named as **app.js**

```javascript
var request = require('request').defaults({ encoding: null });
var fileUrl = 'http://nwjs.io/images/nw.png';
    
request.get(fileUrl, function (err, response, body) {
    
  if (err || response.statusCode != 200)
    throw 'Error retrieving image';
    
  var base64Image = 
    "data:image/png;base64," 
    + new Buffer(body).toString('base64');
    
  // using jQuery to write the response to the UI
  $('#my-img').append('<img src=\"' + base64Image + '\" />');
});
```
---
## Quick Start

- What we are doing with **app.js** is to get an external image resource and add it to our layout
---

```xml
> C:\path\to\nwjs\nw.exe C:\path\to\your\project
